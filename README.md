## Blockers I faced

- ### `problem:` creating nested component in good structure.
    - `problem description:` when I want to add nested component below each category, it's look like my mind stopped working while I'm working on it,
    - `solution:` after writing what inside my head on paper everything become clear.
#
- ### `problem:`
    - `problem description:` setIsActive when I want to do on click event on category to show up the category movies whole page disappeared 
    - `solution:` I was using the arrow function inside the html tag without bind it, I forgot that point I should bind the function or create it as const arrow function inside component scope

#
- ### `problem:`
    - `problem description:` finished design with wrong component structure
    - `solution:` refactored all components (there is a lot of mistakes in css after this refactoring) If I changed any other SASS line the sky will fall on my head after 2 hours of trying to understand what I've done and fixing it, but thanks god it's working.
